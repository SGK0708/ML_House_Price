# ML_House_Price Project

This project predicts house prices in Melbourne using **Machine Learning** techniques, including **L1 and L2 Regularization**.

## Steps:
1. Loaded and explored the Melbourne housing dataset.
2. Cleaned the data (handled missing values, outliers, and categorical features).
3. Applied **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization methods to build the predictive model.
4. Evaluated model performance using different metrics.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the model using regularization techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and code execution.
